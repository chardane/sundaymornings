### First words

Given two strings `a` and `b`, write a program that determines if they start with the same first word. Try to do this **without** using `.split()` or temporary strings. Before you begin, let's take a look at a few examples:

| Value of `a`| Value of `b`| Result |
|------------------------------------|
|"Hello world"| "Hello there"| `true`|
|"Helloooo world"| "Hello there"| `false`|
|"Yay World hooray" | "Hello there you" | `false`|

Here is some skeleton code to get you started:

```javascript
function startsWithSameWord(a, b) {
  //your code here
}
```
You should attempt this problem on you own, but if you need help a solution can be found [here.](same_first_words.js)
