### Palindrome!

This is a classic programming exercise and interview question.

Given a text, determine if a string is a palindrome:
* A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled
the same way when reversed.
* We ignore punctuation, case, and spacing.

Examples : "Kayak",  "Racecar", "Level", Don't nod.", "Red rum, sir, is murder"
