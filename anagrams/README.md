### Anagrams

An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as *cinema*, formed from *iceman*<sup>1</sup>. Write a program that determines if two words, `a` and `b`, are anagrams of each other.

Here is some skeleton code to get you started:

```javascript
function anagram(a, b) {
  //your code here
}
```

You should attempt this problem on you own, but if you need help a solution can be found [here.](anagram.js)
